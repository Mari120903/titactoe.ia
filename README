# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax & Explainable Decisions)

Command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python, featuring an AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with multiple difficulty levels and transparent decision-making.

## Overview
This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against an AI. The AI evaluates game states using Minimax and provides **explicit reasoning output**, explaining why certain moves are chosen, blocked, or avoided.

The focus of the project is not only correctness, but also **explainability of AI behavior**, making the decision process observable and understandable.

## Features
- Human vs AI gameplay in the terminal
- AI powered by Minimax with memoization
- Three difficulty levels:
  - **Easy**: AI frequently makes suboptimal moves
  - **Medium**: AI mixes optimal and random decisions
  - **Hard**: AI always plays optimally
- Explicit AI reasoning:
  - Detects immediate winning moves
  - Detects and blocks human threats
  - Prints evaluation scores for each possible move
- Clear board visualization and input validation

## AI Logic
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible future game states:
- Win for AI: +1
- Win for Human: -1
- Draw: 0

To improve performance, previously evaluated states are cached using memoization.

Before committing to a move, the AI:
1. Checks for immediate winning moves
2. Detects human threats that must be blocked
3. Evaluates all valid moves using Minimax
4. Selects the best move depending on the chosen difficulty

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Minimax algorithm
- Recursive game tree evaluation
- Memoization
- Basic CLI interaction

## How to Run
```bash
python tictactoe.py
